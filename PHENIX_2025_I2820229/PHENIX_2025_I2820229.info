Description:
  'The jet cross section and jet-substructure observables in $p$$+$$p$ 
collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV were measured by the PHENIX 
Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Jets are 
reconstructed from charged-particle tracks and 
electromagnetic-calorimeter clusters using the anti-$k_{t}$ algorithm 
with a jet radius $R=0.3$ for jets with transverse momentum within 
$8.0<p_T<40.0$ GeV/$c$ and pseudorapidity $|\eta|<0.15$.  Measurements 
include the jet cross section, as well as distributions of 
SoftDrop-groomed momentum fraction ($z_g$), charged-particle transverse 
momentum with respect to jet axis ($j_T$), and radial distributions of 
charged particles within jets ($r$).  Also measured was the 
distribution of $\xi=-ln(z)$, where $z$ is the fraction of the jet 
momentum carried by the charged particle. The measurements are compared 
to theoretical next-to and next-to-next-to-leading-order calculations, 
the PYTHIA and HERWIG event generators, and to other 
existing experimental results. Indicated from these measurements is a 
lower particle multiplicity in jets at RHIC energies when compared to 
models.  Also noted are implications for future jet measurements with 
sPHENIX at RHIC as well as at the future Electron-Ion Collider.'

  'This analysis was tested in PYTHIA 8 before approval by the collaboration.'
