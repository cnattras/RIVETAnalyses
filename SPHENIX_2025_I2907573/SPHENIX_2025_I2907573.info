Description:
  'This paper reports measurements of the transverse energy per unit pseudorapidity ($dE_{T}/d\eta$) produced in $Au+Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV, performed with the sPHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The results cover the pseudorapidity range $\left|\eta\right| < 1.1$ and constitute the first such measurement performed using a hadronic calorimeter at RHIC. Measurements of $dE_{T}/d\eta$ are presented for a range of centrality intervals and the average $dE_{T}/d\eta$ as a function of the number of participating nucleons, $N_{part}$, is compared to a variety of Monte Carlo heavy-ion event generators. The results are in agreement with previous measurements at RHIC, and feature an improved granularity in $\eta$ and improved precision in low-$N_{part}$ events.'
