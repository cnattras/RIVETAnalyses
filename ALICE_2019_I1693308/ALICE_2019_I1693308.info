Description:
  'A brief description of what is measured and what it is useful for.
   Use LaTeX for maths, e.g. $\pT > 50\;\GeV$.'
ValidationInfo:
  'A description of the process used to validate the Rivet code against
  the original experimental analysis. Cut-flow tables and similar information
  are welcome'
