Good target.  Eta nuclear modification factor.

Most of this analysis was written by Adam Tilley.  Contributions by Kip Hunt, Sean Grace, Nik Nelson, Joesph Beller.

Old note - check this:  The histogram called 'cross_section' has no entries and I suspect that it is actually a counter and not filled.

With Au+Au higher statistics - so far it looks good!
