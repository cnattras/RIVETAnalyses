This analysis is a shell, but a shell with the grunt work done, oddly enough.  None of the histograms are filled correctly.

This is J/psi photoproduction in UPC.  This is not feasible to use so it's tabled for now.

Unsure who was the original author.  Christal Martin fixed the file name because it had been named wrong.  Contributions from Sean Grace, Nik Nelson, Joesph Beller, Josie Hakanson.

This info file needs to be fixed because it 
points to completely the wrong paper.  The correct paper is
https://inspirehep.net/literature/815217
https://arxiv.org/pdf/0903.2041

myh1 needs to be removed.  This does not actually do anything.

updates: 
-.info file is fixed 
-. histograms are booked not filled or finalized
