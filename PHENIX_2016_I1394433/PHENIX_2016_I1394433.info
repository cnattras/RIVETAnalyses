Description: Measurements of midrapidity charged-particle multiplicity distributions, ${dN_{ch}}/{d\eta}$, and midrapidity transverse-energy distributions, ${dE_T}/{d\eta}$, are presented for a variety of collision systems and energies. Included are distributions for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200, 130, 62.4, 39, 27, 19.6, 14.5, and 7.7GeV, Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 and 62.4GeV, Cu+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200GeV, U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193GeV, $d$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200GeV, He$^3$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200GeV, and $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200GeV. Centrality-dependent distributions at midrapidity are presented in terms of the number of nucleon participants, $N_{part}$, and the number of constituent quark participants, $N_{qp}$. For all A+A collisions down to $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7GeV, it is observed that the midrapidity data are better described by scaling with $N_{qp}$ than scaling with $N_{part}$. Also presented are estimates of the Bjorken energy density, $\epsilon_{BJ}$, and the ratio of ${dE_T}/{d\eta}$ to ${dN_{ch}}/{d\eta}$, the latter of which is seen to be constant as a function of centrality for all systems.
ValidationInfo:
  'Note: this analysis was written well after the paper was written and without the participation of the original authors.  The analysis was approved by the collaboration after tests with PYTHIA Angantyr, HIJING, and AMPT.  See list of options for collision systems and energies.  This analysis will detect beams and energies if they have been set in the HEPMC; otherwise the collision system and energy can be set with the beam option.  This is designed to be used with the output from the RHIC centrality calibration class.'
