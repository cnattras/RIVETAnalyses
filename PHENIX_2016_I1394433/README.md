This is a transverse energy analysis with several different collision systems and energies.  Originally written by Ejiro.  Contributions from Sean Grace, Nik Nelson, Joesph Beller, Iftekhar Ahmed.

The only histograms which are implemented are ET vs centrality and charged particle momentum vs centrality.  The HEPData entry has various manipulations of these data but the most direct comparison is to the ET and Nch.

When the YODA file was fixed, it may have reintroduced an error in the HEPData, which was found earlier.  To be confirmed by comparisons to data.
