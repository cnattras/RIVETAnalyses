This is a J/psi analysis.  It is lovely and may be easy to fix but it's not obvious that it's THAT easy to fix.  Might be a stage two analysis.

Needs bin shift correction

Needs bin options added so that it can either read the beams as written by the generator OR as manually set

Several plots from the paper are only partially implemented.  Needs all of the plots added.


Update: I believe that all of the plots that are not implemented deal with N_{part} so I am not sure how to deal with them. I added beams and binshift.

CN 12/17/25 to-do
- Bin shift correction needs to have protection added
- Beams need to be identified correctly
- Make sure Npart histograms are implemented
- Histogram numbering appears to have changed
- Many, many histograms commented out - I think this one is partially broken.  Not sure how easy it is to fix!
